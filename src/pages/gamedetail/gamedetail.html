				<ion-item text-wrap><h1>10 Awesome Easter Eggs Fans Have Totally Missed</h1></ion-item>
				<ion-item ><img src="assets/imgs/Resident-Evil-2-Remake.jpg"></ion-item>
				<p class="item-md">The Resident Evil franchise is one of the most beloved in the zombie genre. Resident Evil 2, originally released in 1998, is a favorite title in the series and was recently remade and released. The remake has been met with critical acclaim and fans seem to love it, too. For hardcore fans of the original game, the Resident Evil series, orthe zombie genre in general, will notice an epic amount of Easter eggs and references. The game includes every Easter egg from its predecessor as well as a host of original ones, too. Read on to see some of the best-hidden treats in the game!</p>

				<ion-item lines><h1>10. WELCOME LEON</h1></ion-item>
				<ion-item ><img src="assets/imgs/re2_e10.jpg"></ion-item>
				<p class="item-md">Fans of the original game will no doubt remember this infamous detail. The other members of the RPD decided to get a little festive and welcome their new rookie to the station. A paper banner can be found in the original game that reads “Wellcome Leon.” Fans loved the misspelled sign and it became a beloved Easter egg. In the remake, however, a banner hangs in the station to welcome Leon to the force. This one appears to be spelled correctly, leaving some fans let down.</p>

				<ion-item lines><h1>9. RELEASE DATE</h1></ion-item>
				<ion-item ><img src="assets/imgs/re2_e9.jpg"></ion-item>
				<p class="item-md">Starting out at the gas station, you’ll find a variety of Easter eggs. Perhaps the most obscure is the phone number on the door. The number is (555) 129-1998. The original game was released on January 29th, 1998, so only hardcore fans will catch it but it’s one of the most touching nods in the game.</p>

				<ion-item lines><h1>8. FRANK WEST POSTER</h1></ion-item>
				<ion-item ><img src="assets/imgs/re2_e8.jpg"></ion-item>
				<p class="item-md">It’s no secret that fans of any zombie franchise are probably fans of the entire genre. Nothing beats the thrill of the walking dead popping out from an abandoned library stack. If you’re a zombie fanatic, you may have caught this nod to another popular zombie franchise, Dead Rising. Frank West is the protagonist of Dead Rising 1 and 4. He’s a photojournalist who works freelance and brags that he’s covered active war zones. In Resident Evil 2, a poster can be found that reads “Frank East, Photographer for hire.” That’s too good to be a coincidence.</p>

				<ion-item lines><h1>7. ELZA WALKER</h1></ion-item>
				<ion-item ><img src="assets/imgs/re2_e7.jpg"></ion-item>
				<p class="item-md">For dyed-in-the-wool fans of the Resident Evil franchise, this Easter egg is an awesome treat. There was a scraped protagonist in the original version of Resident Evil 2 and her name was Elza Walker. She was a student at Racoon University and an avid motorcyclist. Owners of the Deluxe Edition of the game can experience a piece of the abandoned heroine. The Deluxe Edition contains a special weapon, the ability to revert to the original soundtrack, reversible box art, and five extra character skins. One of these skins is an homage to Elza’s red and white moto kit that Claire can sport.</p>
